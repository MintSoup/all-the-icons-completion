* Requirements
This package only supports Emacs version 26.1 and above.

It requires [[https://github.com/domtronn/all-the-icons.el][all-the-icons]].
* Installation
This package is not yet available on MELPA, so you need to clone it yourself put the file in your load-path.

* Usage
Add the following to your init-file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(all-the-icons-completion-mode)
#+end_src

If you want to use it as an addon to ~marginalia-mode~, add the following to your init-file:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'marginalia-mode-hook #'all-the-icons-completion-marginalia-setup)
#+end_src

This will ensure that it is on when ~marginalia-mode~ is on and is off when it's off.

* Acknowledgements
Thanks to [[https://github.com/minad][@minad]] and [[https://github.com/noctuid][@noctuid]] for getting the ball rolling on the functions used in this package.
